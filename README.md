# Fizz

## **About**

An interpreted scipting language built with Go. The syntax is designed to be easy to understand (coming from other languages) to give a nicer experience. Heres a list of included functionality currently available:

- Standard expressions
- Variables (declaration, assignment, scope)
- Conditions and loops (if and else, while, repeat)

As an example, here is a simple demo program for the infamous fizzbuzz problem:

```lua
repeat n < 10 {
    if n % 15 == 0 {
        print "Fizzbuzz";
        skip;
    }

    if n % 5 == 0 {
        print "Buzz";
        skip;
    }

    if n % 3 == 0 {
        print "Buzz";
        skip;
    }

    print n;
}
```
