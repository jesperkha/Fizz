# Syntax highlighting for Fizz (vscode)

## **Setup**

Run the following command to link the extension to your vscode extension folder: (if you have moved the .vscode folder change it to the correct destination)

```console
$ ln -s ~/path_to_this_folder/fizz-syntax-highlight ~/.vscode/extensions/fizz-syntax-highlight
```

Reload your vscode window and the extension should be working. If not, check the vscode extension folder to see if the fizz extension is there. If it isn't there you can always move/copy the folder manually.
